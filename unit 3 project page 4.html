<p> The forwards are in charge of scoring the goals. They have to put pressure in the defenders and tried to get the ball in the net. the positions you can play as a forward are center forward, left forward, and right forward.
The more goals the forwards score the better the team works. The forwards need to be fast and smart at the same time.
