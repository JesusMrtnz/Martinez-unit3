<p style="color:#0066cc";> The middlefielders are the ones that run the most during a soccer game. They have to help the defense and the forwards as well. The positions you can play as a middlefielder are right winger,center mid, and left winger. They have to be fast thinkers in order to look for spaces and leave the forward in andvantage vs the goalie or defenders. The middlefielders have to have alot of control with the ball and also a very good shot and also be precise. They also have to have a lot of stamina in order to keep going and not get tired during the game.
