<h2>Goal-keeper</h2>
<p style="color:#0066cc";> The goal-keeper has the thoughest job in the field. He is in charge of protecting the goal and not letting the other team score. He exposes himself to get hurt for example by throwing himself and getting scratches and bruises. Another example of golies getting hurt is by the forwards stepping on them,kicking them, or even getting hit by the ball in not wished places.
 </p>
<h2>Defense</h2>
<p style="color:#0066cc";> The defenders are in charge of not letting the forwards getting close to the goal. The positions you can play as a defender are sweeper,center defender,left defense and right defense. The defenders have to be smart and have quick thoughts to examine the forwards of the other team.
